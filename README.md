# templang
template language is a repo so you can translate python keywords into your keywords so it's easier to write in python for you.

## install it like this:

```
  git clone https://github.com/schrodingerwastaken/templang.git
  
  cd path to the repo
  
  chmod +x install.sh
  
  ./install.sh
```
  
  
  
  
this is just for fun and it only works in Linux
